                    Phishing attacks come in many shapes and forms. However, cybercriminals commonly embed malware and malicious content through email, text, or phone calls to obtain our personal information from unsuspecting victims. It is estimated that 3.4 billion phishing emails get sent daily, accounting for about 94% of cyberattack attempts (Griffiths, 2024). Phishing attempts are social engineering attacks in which criminals make it seemingly innocent, like a free iPhone giveaway, to make individuals click an embedded link and have victims spill out their personal information on cloned websites that may seem like the real one (ncsc.gov, 2018). The cybercriminal could then do anything they want with your information, including identity theft, blackmailing, getting into private accounts, and other immoral activities (ncsc.gov, 2018).

                    Methods such as software applications and even educational programs in schools are set in place to help combat the issue of cybersecurity. Software applications may help protect you from existing phishing methods, but they cannot keep up with the constant adaptations cyber criminals are implementing to avoid them (Griffiths, 2024). While you are unaware that your software is not up to date, you may have your information stolen. Currently, cybersecurity implementations in schools are becoming more prevalent. Funds are being allocated to teach this to the younger generation, as 1 in every 43 kids has stolen their personal information (Rahman, 2020). However, an issue with current cybersecurity education is the lack of expertise, as it is challenging to incorporate it into education. Furthermore, many schools lack the money and resources to implement such a program in their education(Amankwa, 2021). Although there is an upward trend in educational programs implementing cyber security, it is not what we believe it should be, as it is a very prevalent issue that everyone needs to be aware of as we transition to a digital world.

                    To address the growing threat of digital attacks, our group will make an online education program that allows users to familiarize themselves with the dangers of the internet. To do this, our group will collaborate and write a program in C++. We will code an algorithm that allows the software to adjust the question based on the user's knowledge. When the client first uses the program, they will be sent for a diagnostic test so the software can measure the client's knowledge. From there, the application will teach the user the topics that they are weak at and periodically throw in questions that they already got right.
